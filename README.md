## About the Project

This is the first web dev task for the delta inductions. The project aims to create a snake game using CSS , HTML and vanilla javascript. 

The game is named as: "SEQUENCE SAFARI".

#

## Features of the Game

- The grid size for the gaem is 20 x 20.
- The snake size keeps on increasing as it continues to eat the food in the form of colored blocks.
- The score of the player increases by 1 as the snake eats each colored block.
- On-Screen direction controls have been provided to steer the snake in all the four directions.
- A "high score" board is designed which keeps a track of the highest score made by a player and stores the value in the local storage.
- The high score value doesn't change until any player scores more than the previous value.
- If the snake eats itself, the game ends.
- If the snake collides with the walls of the board, the game ends.
- A sound is produced if the snake eats a color block, hits itself or dies after hitting the walls of the board.
- A timer has been set to 1 minute which starts ticking as soon as the game starts.
- If within the given time limit, a player crosses the previous high score value, then the player is declared as a winner otherwise he/she loses the game.
- An alert message is displayed for the same and the game stops.
